Cardscape
=========

Cardscape is a generic tool for creating cards used in Collectible/Trading Card Games 
that was born as part of the WTactics project. It now intends to be independent and generic 
enough so that it can be used by anyone wanting to create a CCG.

Requirements
------------

- Apache web server, thought it is the only supported server, _Cardscape_ may work with other web servers that support PHP;
- PHP 5.3+, version 5.1 and 5.2 may also work but we do not guarantee backward compatibility at the moment;
- MySQL 5+ with InnoDB support, we will probably support other relational database servers in the future;
- A recent enough web browser, IE below 10 is not supported so change to Firefox/Chrome/Opera/Safari or 
any of the other fine browsers out there.

Version History
---------------

There are currently no public releases. Most of the versions listed here can also 
be checked in our Sourceforge page, in the ticket section.

v0.2 - Current development version where we try to simplify and stabilize the code.
v0.1 - Migration to Yii PHP framwork, various re-write attempts and false starts.
Before version tracking - Old system made of aggregated PHP files with various functions and mixed HTML.
