Yet another pet project where I throw some code.

This is a fork of the Cardscape project, http://sourceforge.net/projects/cardscape/, 
created as part of WTactics, http://wtactics.org, and that aims to offer a card development 
platform to be used by WTactics.

I'm starting to port some of the existing features to the Yii framework, remove the 
use of smarty template system and update the database.

After I get a usable set of features that represent the project's original state I'll 
try to improve existing features or add new ones.

I should point out that I'm *not* trying to take over the project and that this version 
is in no way endorsed or used by the WTactics team, please refer to the official 
version at SourceForce.net.
