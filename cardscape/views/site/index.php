<h1>Welcome to Cardscape!</h1>

<p>Cardscape is a generic tool for creating cards used in Collectible/Trading Card Games.</p>

<p>
    It was born as part of the WTactics project, http://www.wtactics.org, but 
    intends to be independent and generic enough so that it can be used by anyone 
    wanting to create a CCG.
</p>

<p>
    Cardscape offers a platform where users can collaborate in the creation of 
    cards or that can be used only as a card database used to search card details 
    and information.
</p>

<p>
    It is written in PHP, HTML5 and jQuery and is supported by a MySQL database 
    server. That said, if you have any interest in developing web based applications, 
    with PHP, creating nice HTML5/CSS interfaces or just want to help out, please 
    feel free to contact us and contribute.
