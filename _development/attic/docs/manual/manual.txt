About this document
-------------------

Introduction
------------
Over the last two decades there have been several success stories on collaboration 
over the Internet. Beginning with the development of the _GNU Linux kernel_ and not 
ending with collaborative efforts like _Wikipedia_, the Internet has brought a new 
way of sharing and crafting to human kind.

The World Wide Web is the most used service on the Internet today. It once started 
out as a service to distribute static HTML files and has been further developed 
to become the _Web 2.0_ which uses dynamically generated content.

The fundamental part of the _Web 2.0_ is collaboration. People from all over the 
world can create content and improve or extend existing content.

Cardscape is another one of these _Web 2.0_ tools. It allows the users to create 
concepts for their favorite collecting card games. These concepts may be further 
discussed by the game's community and finally be approved by the game makers.
