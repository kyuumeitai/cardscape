	<h1>Cardscape</h1>
	<p>An open source tool for creating collective card games. Implementation is done in PHP with a generic SQL backend.</p>
	<p>At this moment I haven't that much to write about this project yet. If you like to learn more, see <a href="http://wtactics.org">wtactics.org</a> as Cardscape was created as part of the WTactics project.</p>
